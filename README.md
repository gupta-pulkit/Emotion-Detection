# Emotion-Detection
The Emotion_Recognize_Training.py file has the model in it. The model uses CNN for training the data and after training the model is saved as JSON files.
The model loaded in emotion_recognize.py is different because it was trained at Kaggle kernel and was saved as model_v6_26.hdf5.  
For better results, tune some of the hyper-parameters like learning rate,optimizer,batch size etc or use the cross validation data to understand overfitting.
